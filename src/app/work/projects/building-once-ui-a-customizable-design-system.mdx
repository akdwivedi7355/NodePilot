## Overview

Developed a robust library management system for CSJM University to efficiently handle book inventories, student borrowing records, fine tracking, and digital cataloging.

## Key Features

- **Book Tracking**: Implemented a detailed book inventory system supporting ISBN registration, availability status, and automated restocking alerts.
- **User Management**: Integrated role-based access for students, staff, and admins. Provided dashboards to view lending history, overdue notices, and personal recommendations.
- **Barcode Integration**: Enabled barcode scanning for quick book check-ins and checkouts.
- **Search & Filter System**: Added a powerful search engine using SQL full-text search to allow filtering by author, title, genre, and year of publication.
- **Fine Calculation & Reporting**: Auto-calculates fines for late returns and generates monthly usage reports for administration.

## Technologies Used

- **Python (Flask)**: Backend development for handling core library operations and API routing.
- **MySQL**: Used for structured data storage, relational queries, and analytics.
- **Bootstrap & JavaScript**: For responsive UI and dynamic front-end elements.
- **Zebra Barcode Scanner**: Integrated for physical book scanning and check-in/out processes.

## Challenges and Learnings

Handling real-world data inconsistencies like duplicate ISBNs and outdated book records presented unique data cleaning challenges. Designing the system to be usable by both tech-savvy and non-technical library staff required careful UX consideration. Working closely with university librarians helped improve system workflows and usability.

## Outcome

The system is now fully operational at CSJM University and has streamlined the management of over 10,000+ books. It reduced manual entry errors, improved resource tracking, and cut down the average service time per student by 40%.
